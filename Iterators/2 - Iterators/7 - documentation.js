// Iterator Documentation
// There are many additional built-in array methods, a complete list of which is on the MDN’s Array iteration methods page.

// The documentation for each method contains several sections:

// A short definition.
// A block with the correct syntax for using the method.
// A list of parameters the method accepts or requires.
// The return value of the function.
// An extended description.
// Examples of the method’s use.
// Other additional information.
// In the instructions below, there are some errors in the code. Use the documentation for a given method to determine the error or fill in a blank to make the code run correctly.




// In the code editor, there is an array called words. We want to create a new array of interesting words. The first thing we want to do is check if there are words that are fewer than 6 characters long. There is something missing in the words.some() method call. Fix this method so that true is printed to the console.
// For more information browse MDN’s documentation on .some() .

// The .some() method returned true, which means there are some words in the array that are shorter than six characters. Use the .filter() method to save any words longer than 5 characters to a new variable called interestingWords, declared with const.
// We’ve used .filter() in a previous exercise, but, for more information browse MDN’s documentation on .filter() 

// In the last line of main.js, there is this code:
// // console.log(interestingWords.every(word =>        ));
// Complete the code between the parentheses to check if every element has more than 5 characters.
// Make sure to uncomment (delete the // before) the last line of the program before you run the code.
// For more information browse MDN’s documentation on .every() .


const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some(word => {
    return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords = words.filter((word) => { return word.length > 5 });


// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => { return word.length > 5 }));
